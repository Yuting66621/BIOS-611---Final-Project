# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of the Hepatitis C dataset, exploring clinical variables to understand disease patterns and develop predictive models. The analysis follows a data science workflow from initial exploration through advanced modeling.

## 1.2 Research Questions

The analysis addresses several key questions:

1. **Data Quality**: What is the structure and quality of the dataset? Are there missing values or anomalies?
2. **Feature Relationships**: How do different clinical markers correlate with each other?
3. **Dimensionality**: Can we reduce the feature space while preserving important information?
4. **Prediction**: Can we build accurate models to classify Hepatitis C categories?
5. **Feature Importance**: Which clinical markers are most important for prediction?
